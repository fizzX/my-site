It's the second to last week of classes before reading period, and boy am I busy. Just taking a few minutes to add a few posts to this website for the HCS Comp. I haven't used ruby/jekyll before to build websites, but it's similar to other tools I've used before. I'll take the time to learn more about jekyll during break, as I've got 2 psets and 2 presentations next week :/
